########### Understanding CI/CD

In the modern-day application developement lifecycle processes,AGILE developement lifecycle is used and,
it is common to have frequent changes to the application codes...

    [ AGILE is a developement lifecycle model in which each member of the developement team ( developers,testers,business analysts..etc)
      works on the same set of requirements at the same time...
      apps requirements are divided into various sets of prirotized requirements...
      A SPRINT is a timeframe in which a single set of requirement is worked on ,from the phase of requirements 
      review until their final implementation in an application... ]

    [ Before the CICD implementation developement team were facing issues like:
                      - regression defects
                      - integration defects
                      - merge conflicts...
       those have required hours to address them...
       
    Then with the avvent of CI, developers changes are merged in their main branch where  all codes changes
    are automatically  triggered for the CI processes...                     ]  

###### Dev Workflow
            - Running Unit Tests Locally
       The developer obtains its own copy of the latest code from the central repo and implement the required changes...
       The developement and changes to the code continue until all written unit test cases pass...

            - Push and Merge code to the Central repo
        Once the developer finishes the developement work in the local copy, he push this code to the central repo,
        to be merged into the dev main branch...

             - Running Tests on the Merged code
        After a successful code merged,the unit, integration, and static code analysis are executed to reveal any 
        regression defects,existence of dead code, and so on...

              - Deploying an Artifact
        Once the merged codes are checked against various quality attributes,an artifact is built and deployed to the
        deployment server...
        All stable codes are packed and deployed to the server for the end users to use...
        These Artifacts are in the form of .WAR, .JAR for instance...
