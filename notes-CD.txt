###################### CD( Continuous Delivery/Deployment ):

In Continuous Intergration , incremental changes to the app codes are tested in a dev env to reveal any failures...
[ Sometimes it may happen that an app is working smoothly in Dev env , but having problems in Prod env...
  These problems could be because a new change is not compatible with hardware/software in Prod env...
  Solution: Iac: Infrastructure as code can provide the same Infrastructure in Dev and Prod to avoid encounter such blems...
                 It provides consistency in infra provisioning so that what work in Dev can smoothly work in Prod...]

There are 2 open source players in the industry to manage DB updates:

pre-Deployment:
         - code stability: checkstyle is used by maven to maintain codes quality best practice...
         - code quality
         - unit tests    : mvn test...uses the test written by developpers
         - code coverage: mvn cobertura:cobertura...maven uses  the cobertura plugin the execute this test
         - security tests: mvn org.owasp:dependency-check-maven:check...maven OWASP plugin to check code  dependencies vulnerability 

intermediate operations:
          - artifacts management
          - database versioning

post-Deployment Intergrations:
           - smoke tests    
           - regression tests
           - API tests
