   In CICD practice, we continuously integrate a smaller number of changes frequently,test them, and provide
   feedback on each increment we introduce into the build...
   Managing this process manually would be labor intensive, tedious, cumbersome, and errors prone...

   [ The CICD process executes the workflow on any app, beginning by taking the latest copy od the code
      from the SCM like Git or SVN...
     It then compile the code with a compiler( ex: maven for java apps...), and execute the unit tests
     again interacting with a different set of tools...

   [ Jenkins can automate all CICD processes on differents platforms...
     It also allows you to automate pull-request integration processes along with artifacts publishing on
     Artifactory Repo like NEXUS...
     Jenkins interacts with differents sets of tools and executes an end-to-end(e2e) workflow on and app at 
     a specific frequency, without putting any unnecessary pressure on the teams building the app...  ] 

   [ Jenkins is a CICD tool that helps to automate different phases of the software developement process, including
     pulling the latest copy of the source code from the centralized SCM repo, compiling the source code,
     running any unit tests,building and publishing all related artifacts in artifactories,and then deploy those
     artifacts on differents env...
