#### DOCKER
       - dockee client
       - docker daemon
       - docker registry
       - docker image
            . 2 ways to create images inside Docker : "" Docker commits  and Dockerfile""
               *** docker commit <container-id>
               *** docker build -t <image_name>:<image_tags> -f Dockerfile  
            .  Dockerfile:
                  contains all commands  a user can run on cli to assemble an image...
                  * Dockerfile content example:
                        FROM naven:latest
                        COPY ./usr/src/mymaven
                        WORKDIR /usr/src/mymaven/
                        RUN mvn clean install
                        RUN mvn clean package 
                        ENTRYPOINT ["java", "-jar"]
                        CMD ["/usr/src/mymaven/app.jar"]

                        FROM:       is to call a base image from the registry; it should be a valid image name.
                        COPY:       is a step that is used to copy content from the local filesystem to an image.
                        WORKDIR:    is used to set the working directory in which other Dockerfile steps will be performed.
                        RUN:        is to execute any command inside the docker image.
                        ENTRYPOINT: allows us to run executable files or commands, like Java and node. 
                                    It is the main command that allows a Docker container to run a process.
                        CMD:        is an instruction that can be executed once after the Dockerfile is built,
                                    generally, people use CMD to pass arguments to ENTRYPOINT.
                        USER:       used to change the user of the docker image. 
                                    whenever a container is started,it will be started with the defined user...

                . Multistage Dockerfile:
                                        


            . Docker build:
                   allows users to automate the execution of several commands at once using multiple command-line instructions...

***** Deployement Strategies:   are various ways of deploying apps based on used cases...
              examples: - Normal: we simple remove version A and deploy version B on n the app server with downtime...
                        - Rolling Update:
                                   Rolling Update:
                                       Concept:

                                             You replace the old version gradually, instance by instance, until all are running the new version.

                                             At any point, the environment is a mix of old and new versions.

                                             Process

                                             Take one (or a few) instances of the old version out of rotation.

                                             Deploy the new version to those instances.

                                             Put them back into service.

                                             Repeat until all old version instances are replaced.

                                       Pros:

                                             No downtime (services are always running).

                                             No need for duplicate environments.

                                             Less infrastructure cost than Blue-Green.

                                       Cons:

                                             Harder to roll back — you’d need to re-roll to the old version.

                                             For a short time, users may hit different versions (could cause session/data issues).

                                             Harder to isolate new version issues compared to Canary.

                                          Concept:

                                                You have two identical environments:

                                                      Blue → current production version

                                                      Green → new version

                                                      Only one is live at a time.

                                                Process:

                                                      Deploy new version to the inactive environment (e.g., Green).

                                                      Test it fully without affecting users.

                                                      Switch traffic from Blue → Green (DNS update, load balancer switch, etc.).

                                                      If something fails, switch back to Blue quickly.

                                                Pros:

                                                      Instant rollback (just flip traffic back).

                                                      Zero downtime.

                                                      Production-like testing before go-live.

                                                Cons:

                                                      Requires duplicate infrastructure (cost).

                                                      Switching is “all-or-nothing” (no gradual rollout).
                        - Canary :
                              2️⃣ Canary Deployment:
                                    Concept:

                                          Deploy new version to a small percentage of users first (the canary group), while the rest still use the old version.

                                          Gradually increase traffic to the new version if it works well.

                                    Process:

                                          Deploy the Canary version alongside the Baseline version.

                                          Route a small percentage of traffic to Canary (e.g., 5–10%).

                                          Monitor performance, errors, user feedback.

                                          If stable → gradually increase traffic until Canary becomes 100%.

                                          If unstable → rollback only the Canary traffic, rest is unaffected.

                                    Pros:

                                          Safer rollouts (issues affect fewer users).

                                          Easy performance monitoring in production.

                                          Minimal risk of full-scale outages.

                                    Cons:

                                          More complex traffic management (needs load balancer support).

                                          Slightly longer rollout time compared to Blue-Green.
