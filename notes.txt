#### DOCKER
       - dockee client
       - docker daemon
       - docker registry
       - docker image
            . 2 ways to create images inside Docker : "" Docker commits  and Dockerfile""
               *** docker commit <container-id>
               *** docker build -t <image_name>:<image_tags> -f Dockerfile  
            .  Dockerfile:
                  contains all commands  a user can run on cli to assemble an image...
                  * Dockerfile content example:
                        FROM naven:latest
                        COPY ./usr/src/mymaven
                        WORKDIR /usr/src/mymaven/
                        RUN mvn clean install
                        RUN mvn clean package 
                        ENTRYPOINT ["java", "-jar"]
                        CMD ["/usr/src/mymaven/app.jar"]

                        FROM:       is to call a base image from the registry; it should be a valid image name.
                        COPY:       is a step that is used to copy content from the local filesystem to an image.
                        WORKDIR:    is used to set the working directory in which other Dockerfile steps will be performed.
                        RUN:        is to execute any command inside the docker image.
                        ENTRYPOINT: allows us to run executable files or commands, like Java and node. 
                                    It is the main command that allows a Docker container to run a process.
                        CMD:        is an instruction that can be executed once after the Dockerfile is built,
                                    generally, people use CMD to pass arguments to ENTRYPOINT.
                        USER:       used to change the user of the docker image. 
                                    whenever a container is started,it will be started with the defined user...
                                    If this parameter is not defined, the default root user will be used...

                . Multistage Dockerfile:
                                        


            . Docker build:
                   allows users to automate the execution of several commands at once using multiple command-line instructions...
